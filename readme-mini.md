Release Notes - v0.75.2

What's new
----------
- Ship tab layout rebuilt: left hardpoints/utility and right core/optional panels sit side-by-side, filling available width without the old header gap.
- Loadout rows wrap engineering summaries and hide native scrollbars via custom panels for smoother scrolling and aligned widths.
- Bottom stats bar now uniform with consistent borders; values sit directly under labels (Ship Value, Mass, Armor, Cargo, Jump, Rebuy).
- Jump range pulls MaxJumpRange when available to avoid inflated numbers; engineering info restored to module rows with tooltips.
- Section headers widened/padded to prevent truncation; placeholder handling shows "EMPTY" instead of hiding blanks.
