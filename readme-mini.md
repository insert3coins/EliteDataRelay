Release Notes - v0.74.2

What's new
----------

- Removed the non-functional “Motherlodes” column from the Mining tab to avoid empty data.
- Mining tab “Collected” values now track cargo scoops so the column reflects mined ore pickups.
- Mining tab keeps the last session yield visible even when the session ends or no new activity occurs.
- Ship tab received a complete visual refresh with a modern summary card, clearer stats grid, and cleaner module section.
- Module breakdown cards were restyled to tighter, scroll-friendly tiles without the redundant status badge.
