Release Notes - v0.72.1

What's new

- Dedicated Session tab replaces the pop-out summary and now shows live stats (duration, profit/hour, mining metrics, history) updating every second.
- Overlay session data moved to its own toggleable overlay, freeing the cargo overlay while keeping stats visible.
- Mining/session histories are automatically exported as JSON files in `%AppData%\EliteDataRelay\sessions` for external tooling or backups.
