Release Notes - v0.77.2

What's new
----------
- Next Jump overlay layout: target banner, class badge, jumps left, hop list, and fade/hold behavior during FSD.
- Overlay settings now include toggles for the Jump overlay, and per-overlay borders alongside updated defaults.
- Jump overlay rendering tightened: fixed-size canvas (480x180), spacing tweaks, better star-class fallback, longer post-jump hold, and no excess bottom gap.
- Exploration overlay refreshed with aligned label/value rows and a leaner fixed size (400x230) for cleaner presentation.
